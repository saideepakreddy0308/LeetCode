**More on 3 * 3 sub box:

Certainly! Let's delve into the expression `[(i // 3) * 3 + j // 3]` and understand how it is used to represent the index of the 3x3 sub-box in the Sudoku board.
​
In a Sudoku board, there are 9 sub-boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid. To uniquely identify each sub-box, we can use the pair of indices `(i // 3, j // 3)`, where `i` and `j` are the row and column indices of a cell in the 9x9 board.
​
Here's how the expression `[(i // 3) * 3 + j // 3]` is constructed and why it works:
​
1. **`(i // 3)`**: Dividing the row index `i` by 3 gives us the quotient of the division. This effectively groups the rows into sets of three. For example, rows 0, 1, and 2 will have the same quotient (0), rows 3, 4, and 5 will have the quotient 1, and rows 6, 7, and 8 will have the quotient 2.
​
2. **`* 3`**: Multiplying the quotient by 3 brings the result back to the original scale of the row indices. This ensures that the grouping is done on a 3x3 scale.
​
3. **`+ j // 3`**: Adding the column index `j // 3` adjusts the grouping based on the columns within each set of three rows. The division `j // 3` groups columns into sets of three within each row set.
​
Combining these steps gives us a unique index for each 3x3 sub-box on the Sudoku board.
​
Let's illustrate this with an example:
​
For a cell with indices `(i, j)`, the expression `[(i // 3) * 3 + j // 3]` will give us a unique index for the corresponding 3x3 sub-box.
​
For example, if `i = 4` and `j = 7` (using 0-based indexing), the calculation would be:
​
```
[(4 // 3) * 3 + 7 // 3] = [1 * 3 + 2] = [5]
```
​
So, the cell at (4, 7) belongs to the 5th sub-box in the Sudoku board.
​
This expression is a convenient way to map each cell to its corresponding 3x3 sub-box and is commonly used in Sudoku-solving algorithms.
​
I hope this clarifies the purpose of the expression! If you have further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask.
