### Explanation:
​
- Rows represent the first `i` elements of the array.
- Columns represent the target sum `j`.
- The value at `dp[i][j]` is `True` if it's possible to achieve the sum `j` using the first `i` elements.
​
For example, at `i = 4` and `j = 8`, `dp[4][8]` is `True` because it's possible to achieve the sum `8` using the first `4` elements (`[1, 5, 11, 5]`) by partitioning it into subsets `[1, 5, 5]` and `[11]`.
​
### Partitioning Result:
​
The final result is obtained from `dp[4][8]`, which is `True`. This means it's possible to partition the array into two subsets with equal sums.
​
Hence, the output is `true`, and the array can be partitioned as `[1, 5, 5]` and `[11]`.
​
This dynamic programming solution efficiently determines whether it's possible to achieve a specific sum using a subset of the given numbers.
