**Intelligent Approach**
The working idea of it behind.
â€‹
1. Observation:
Notice that each ugly number is generated by multiplying a smaller ugly number by 2, 3, or 5.
Since we want the nth ugly number, we need to find a way to efficiently generate and keep track of the ugly numbers in sorted order.
2. Dynamic Programming Array:
Realize that you can use a dynamic programming array to store the ugly numbers in sorted order.
The idea is to start with the first ugly number (1) and then iteratively generate the next ugly numbers by multiplying the current ugly numbers by 2, 3, and 5.
3. Pointers for Factors:
Introduce three pointers (p2, p3, p5) to keep track of the positions of the current ugly numbers for factors 2, 3, and 5.
These pointers help in efficiently generating the next ugly numbers without redundantly calculating them.
4. Generating Ugly Numbers:
At each step, generate three potential candidates for the next ugly number by multiplying the current ugly numbers at the pointers by 2, 3, and 5.
Choose the minimum among these candidates as the next ugly number and update the dynamic programming array.
Move the pointers forward based on which factor was chosen.
5. Iterative Construction:
Iterate through this process until you have generated the nth ugly number.
6. Result:
The result is the last element in the dynamic programming array, which is the nth ugly number.
7. Optimizations:
You might also observe that you can optimize the solution by avoiding unnecessary calculations when the same number is generated by multiple factors.
8. Practice:
Dynamic programming is a skill that improves with practice. Solving more problems and gaining exposure to different types of dynamic programming solutions will help you build intuition.
Remember that developing intuition for dynamic programming often involves trying different approaches, making observations, and refining your understanding based on those observations
