7. **Calculate Length of Valid Substring:**
- At each step, the algorithm calculates the length of the current valid substring as `len(s) - start`.
​
8. **Find Longest Valid Substring:**
- The algorithm continues this process until it reaches the end of the string.
- At the end, the length of the longest valid substring is obtained by subtracting the `start` index from the total length of the string.
​
In summary, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the window to find the longest valid substring. Whenever it encounters a situation where the number of characters to be replaced exceeds `k`, it moves the `start` pointer to maintain a valid window, ensuring that the count of replacements stays within the allowed limit. The final result is the length of the longest valid substring found during the entire process.
​
**Yes, you've correctly identified a key aspect of the algorithm. Once the window is expanded to include the character with the maximum count (`max_count`), if at any point the number of characters to be replaced exceeds the allowed limit (`k`), the algorithm doesn't shrink the window but instead moves the entire window forward.**
​
The movement of the window is determined by the `start` pointer. When the condition `(end - start + 1 - max_count) > k` is true, it means that there are more characters to be replaced than allowed. In this case, the algorithm adjusts the window by moving the `start` pointer forward. This effectively keeps the window size constant or allows it to grow, but it never shrinks.
​
This approach ensures that the algorithm explores all possible valid substrings by considering different starting points (`start`). The `max_count` is updated based on the characters encountered as the window moves forward, and the algorithm adapts to find the longest valid substring with at most `k` replacements.
​
In summary, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the window to maximize the length of valid substrings while ensuring that the number of replacements stays within the allowed limit.
**
Realize that when the number of characters to be replaced exceeds k, the window doesn't shrink but moves forward.
This dynamic adjustment allows the algorithm to explore different valid substrings by considering different starting points.**
