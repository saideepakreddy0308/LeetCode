Let's analyze the time complexity (T.C.) and space complexity (S.C.) of the provided solution:
​
### Time Complexity (T.C.):
​
The time complexity is determined by the number of recursive calls and the work done in each call.
​
- The `backtrack` function is called for each digit in the input `digits`.
- For each digit, the function is called recursively, exploring all possible combinations.
- The total number of recursive calls is exponential, as it depends on the number of letters corresponding to each digit.
​
Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(3^N \times 4^M)\), where \(N\) is the number of digits mapping to three letters ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '8') and \(M\) is the number of digits mapping to four letters ('7', '9'). This is because each digit contributes either three or four letters.
​
### Space Complexity (S.C.):
​
The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursive call stack and the auxiliary data structures.
​
- The maximum depth of the recursive call stack is equal to the length of the input `digits`.
- The additional space is used for the `current` string in each recursive call. In the worst case, the maximum size of `current` is equal to the length of `digits`.
​
Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(N + M)\).
​
In summary:
- Time Complexity: \(O(3^N \times 4^M)\)
- Space Complexity: \(O(N + M)\)
​
These complexities capture the exponential nature of the problem, as the number of possible combinations grows with the number of digits that map to multiple letters.
