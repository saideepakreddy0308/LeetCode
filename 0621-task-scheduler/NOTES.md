​
In this arrangement, we execute 'A' three times, followed by 'B' three times, and we use the idle slots to wait for the cooldown period.
​
### Problem Simplification:
​
To simplify the problem, we can think of it in terms of constructing a schedule to execute the tasks efficiently, minimizing the total time required.
​
### Key Points:
​
1. **Frequency of Tasks:**
- Identify the frequency of each task in the given array.
​
2. **Most Frequent Tasks First:**
- Execute the most frequent tasks first to minimize the time.
​
3. **Utilize Cooldown Period:**
- Place tasks in such a way that the cooldown period is effectively utilized.
​
4. **Idle Slots:**
- Introduce idle slots when necessary to wait for the cooldown period.
​
### Goal:
​
The goal is to construct an efficient schedule that minimizes the total time required to execute all tasks.
