Certainly! Here's a short key understanding of the working steps for the "210. Course Schedule II" problem:
​
1. **Build Graph:**
- Create a directed graph using an adjacency list to represent prerequisites.
​
2. **Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm):**
- Initialize an array to store the in-degrees (number of prerequisites) for each course.
- Initialize a queue and add courses with an in-degree of 0 to the queue.
- Perform a modified BFS (Breadth-First Search):
- For each course in the queue, reduce the in-degree of its neighbors.
- If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
- Continue this process until the queue is empty.
​
3. **Result:**
- If the number of courses visited is equal to the total number of courses, return the topological order; otherwise, return an empty array.
​
This algorithm ensures that you take courses in an order that satisfies the prerequisites. If there's a valid order, it returns that order; otherwise, it returns an empty array indicating it's not possible to finish all courses.
