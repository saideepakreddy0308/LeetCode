This example demonstrates how the `generateParenthesis` method generates all valid combinations of parentheses for the input `n = 3`.
​
### Time Complexity (T.C.) and Space Complexity (S.C.):
​
- **Time Complexity (T.C.):**
- The time complexity is determined by the number of valid combinations generated.
- In the worst case, the total number of valid combinations is the \(n^{th}\) Catalan number, which is \(O(\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}})\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}})\).
​
- **Space Complexity (S.C.):**
- The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursive call stack and the auxiliary data structures.
- The maximum depth of the recursive call stack is \(2n\), corresponding to the length of the generated combinations.
- The additional space is used for the `result` list, which can have a maximum size of \(O(\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}})\) for the same reason as the time complexity.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}})\).
​
In summary:
- Time Complexity: \(O(\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}})\)
- Space Complexity: \(O(\frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}})\)
