â€‹The time complexity of this code is O(N*log(L)), where N is the length of the input list time and L is the maximum value that can be in the list, given that MAX_NUMBER_OF_TRIPS is a constant.

The while loop is a binary search that takes O(log(L)) iterations, where L is the difference between the upper and lower bounds, which can be at most min(time) * MAX_NUMBER_OF_TRIPS.

Within each iteration, sum([mid//t for t in time]) takes O(N) time as it calculates the number of trips that can be made within mid time units for each element in the time list, and mid//t takes constant time for each element.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N*log(L)).

The space complexity of this code is O(1), since it uses only a few constant variables, and the memory usage does not depend on the input size.
