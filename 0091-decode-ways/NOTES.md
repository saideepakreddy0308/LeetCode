- '2' is not '0', so `dp[2] += dp[1]` (updating the count for the current digit)
- Check if the previous and current digits form a valid two-digit code: `'10' <= '22' <= '26'` (True)
- Since it's true, `dp[2] += dp[0]` (adding the count from two positions back)
- Updated `dp`: `[1, 1, 2, 0]`
​
4. Iteration 3 (i = 3):
- Current digit: '6'
- '6' is not '0', so `dp[3] += dp[2]` (updating the count for the current digit)
- Check if the previous and current digits form a valid two-digit code: `'10' <= '26' <= '26'` (True)
- Since it's true, `dp[3] += dp[1]` (adding the count from two positions back)
- Updated `dp`: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`
​
The final result is `dp[3]`, which is 3, representing the total number of ways to decode the string "226."
​
**Explanation:**
​
- At each step, `dp[i]` is updated based on the count of ways to decode the current digit (`dp[i - 1]`) and, if applicable, the count of ways to decode the two digits at the previous position (`dp[i - 2]`).
- In the example, the digits '2' and '2' can be combined to form the valid code '22'. Therefore, we add the count from two positions back (`dp[i - 2]`) to the current count (`dp[i]`).
​
- This approach ensures that we consider both single-digit and two-digit decodings, covering all possible ways to decode the given string.

_______________________________________________
​
The initialization dp[0] = 1 is a common practice in dynamic programming, and it often corresponds to a base case that ensures the algorithm starts with a valid state.
​
In this specific problem, setting dp[0] = 1 is necessary because the dynamic programming array dp is used to store the number of ways to decode the string up to the current index. When starting at index 1, there is no previous digit to decode, so setting dp[0] = 1 essentially means that there is one way to decode an empty string, and it serves as a base case for the dynamic programming recursion.
