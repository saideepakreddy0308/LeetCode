â€‹This code is an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of an array, where each element of the array represents the maximum distance that can be jumped from that position.

The code first creates a graph using a defaultdict from the collections module. The keys of the dictionary are the values in the input array, and the values are sets containing the indices where each value occurs in the array.

Next, a queue is initialized with a tuple (0,0), which represents the starting index and the number of steps taken to reach that index. A set called vis is also initialized to keep track of visited indices.

In the while loop, the code dequeues the first tuple from the queue and assigns its values to now and steps. If now is equal to the last index in the array, the code returns steps as the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end.

Otherwise, the code checks if the indices now+1 and now-1 have not been visited and are within the bounds of the array. If they meet these conditions, they are added to the vis set and a tuple containing the new index and steps+1 is appended to the queue.

Finally, the code iterates through the set of indices in the graph that have the same value as arr[now]. For each index jump that has not been visited, it is added to vis and a tuple containing jump and steps+1 is appended to the queue. After all the jumps in the set have been processed, the key arr[now] is deleted from the graph to avoid revisiting the same jumps again.

This process continues until the queue is empty or the end of the array is reached. At the end of the loop, if the end of the array has not been reached, it means that it is not possible to reach the end of the array and the code returns -1.
