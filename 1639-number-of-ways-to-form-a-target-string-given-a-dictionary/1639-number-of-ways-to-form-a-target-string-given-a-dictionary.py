    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        # Get the length of words and target

        m = len(target)
        mod = 10**9 + 7  # Define a constant for modulo operation
        dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # Initialize an array to store dynamic programming values
        dp[0] = 1  # Set the base case for dp[0] to 1, since there is only one way to form an empty string

        count = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize a 2D array to store the count of each character in words
        for word in words:
            for i in range(n):
                count[i][ord(word[i]) - ord('a')] += 1  # Count the occurrence of each character in words

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
                # Update dp[j + 1] by multiplying dp[j] with the count of target[j]th character in the ith position of words
                dp[j + 1] += dp[j] * count[i][ord(target[j]) - ord('a')]
                dp[j + 1] %= mod  # Take modulo to prevent integer overflow

        return dp[m]  # Return the final value in dp array, which represents the total number of ways to form target

# Time Complexity: O(n * m)
# Space Complexity: O(n * 26)

# In summary, the code uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the target string by selecting characters from each position of the given list of words. The count of characters in words is pre-calculated and stored in a 2D array for efficiency. The final result is returned as the last element in the dp array.
